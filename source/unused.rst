===========

Gather works using proximity. This means that you can see and hear people
that are near you.

The tables in the Auditorium are "private areas". That means that when you
sit at a table you can see and hear only the people at the table.

In addition, people can be "spotlighted", meaning that they can be heard by
the whole room. I'll spotlight myself to talk to everyone, and may spotlight
others asking questions while I'm speaking to the whole class.

If you need help please raise your hand! To do this in Gather, press :kbd:`6` once,
or click on the smiley face icon then on the open hand icon to the right.
Raising your hand in Gather
is "sticky"â€’it stays raised until you lower it by pressing
:kbd:`6` or clicking the icon again.

You can also come and find a tutor. We'll add **(tutor)** to our names so you know
who we are.
